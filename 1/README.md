# Introduction - Learn Python for Data Science #1

Welcome to the 1st Episode of Learn Python for Data Science! This series will teach you Python and Data Science at the same time! In this video we install Python and our text editor (Sublime Text), then build a gender classifier using the sci-kit learn library in just about 10 lines of code.

Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the demo.py code. Train them on the same dataset and compare their results. You can determine accuracy by trying to predict testing you trained classifier on samples from the training data and see if it correctly classifies it. Push your code repository to github then post it in the comments. I'll give the winner a shoutout a week from now!
