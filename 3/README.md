# Recommendation Systems - Learn Python for Data Science #3

In this video, we build our own recommendation system that suggests movies a user would like in 40 lines of Python using the LightFM recommendation library. I start off by talking about why we need recommendation systems, then we dive straight into installing our dependencies and writing our script. 

1. Instead of using the built-in fetch_movielens method, create your own method to fetch and parse a recommendation dataset of your choice. You can find some good dataset options here. Make sure to look at the fetch_movielens method to see how it works.

2. Use 3 different loss functions (so 3 different models), compare their results, and then only print the recommendations (products, songs, tv shows, etc.) for the best one. You'll find the available loss functions here.
