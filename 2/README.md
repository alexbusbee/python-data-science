# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Learn Python for Data Science #2

In this video we'll be building our own Twitter Sentiment Analyzer in just 14 lines of Python. It will be able to search twitter for a list of tweets about any topic we want, then analyze each tweet to see how positive or negative it's emotion is. 

Instead of printing out each tweet, save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. You can define the sentiment polarity threshold yourself, whatever you think constitutes a tweet being positive/negative. Push your code repository to github then post it in the comments. I'll give the winner a shoutout a week from now!
